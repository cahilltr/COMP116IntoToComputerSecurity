- "Pray and Patch" -> "Keep building, keep selling, and send out fixes as necessary.  If a system failed, ..., the burden fell not on the giant, rich tech companies but on their customers."
- "Featureitis" -> new features are added mroe quickly than they can be made secure.

#### Reflections on Trusting Trust - https://tuftsdev.github.io/DefenseAgainstTheDarkArts/readings/p761-thompson.pdf
- "More precisely stated, the problem is to write a source program that, when compiled and executed, will produce as output an exact copy of its source."
- "Thus if this code were installed in binary and the binary were used to compile the login command, I could log into that system as any user"
- "You can't trust code that you did not totally create yourself"

#### Programmers: Stop Calling Yourselves Engineers - https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/programmers-should-not-call-themselves-engineers/414271/
- Engineers need to get things right the first time; software tends not too
- "Professional Engineering certification is usually offered only in fields where something could go terribly, horribly wrong with unqualified actors at the helm."
- 'The U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics (BLS) calls the “engineers” who work at Google and Uber and Facebook and its ilk “Computer Programmers” or “Software Developers.”'
