## Week 1

### Slide Notes

### Readings

#### A Disaster Foretold --and Ignored (Washington Post) - https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2015/06/22/net-of-insecurity-part-3/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.24978e555d1f
- "Pray and Patch" -> "Keep building, keep selling, and send out fixes as necessary.  If a system failed, ..., the burden fell not on the giant, rich tech companies but on their customers."
- "Featureitis" -> new features are added mroe quickly than they can be made secure.

#### Reflections on Trusting Trust - https://tuftsdev.github.io/DefenseAgainstTheDarkArts/readings/p761-thompson.pdf
- "More precisely stated, the problem is to write a source program that, when compiled and executed, will produce as output an exact copy of its source."
- "Thus if this code were installed in binary and the binary were used to compile the login command, I could log into that system as any user"
- "You can't trust code that you did not totally create yourself"

#### Programmers: Stop Calling Yourselves Engineers - https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/programmers-should-not-call-themselves-engineers/414271/
- Engineers need to get things right the first time; software tends not too
- "Professional Engineering certification is usually offered only in fields where something could go terribly, horribly wrong with unqualified actors at the helm."
- 'The U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics (BLS) calls the “engineers” who work at Google and Uber and Facebook and its ilk “Computer Programmers” or “Software Developers.”'

#### Defending Against Hackers Took a Back Seat at Yahoo, Insiders Say - https://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/09/29/technology/yahoo-data-breach-hacking.html
- 'The “Paranoids,” the internal name for Yahoo’s security team, often clashed with other parts of the business over security costs.'
- "To make computer systems more secure, a company often has to make its products slower and more difficult to use."

#### Verizon 2018 Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) - https://tuftsdev.github.io/DefenseAgainstTheDarkArts/readings/rp_DBIR_2018_Report_en_xg.pdf
- "When breaches are successful, the time to compromise continues to be very short"
- " The discovery time is also very dependent on the type of attack, with payment card compromises often discovered based on the fraudulent use of the stolen data (typically weeks or months) as opposed to a stolen laptop which is discovered when the victim realizes they have been burglarized."
- "Pretexting (170 incidents, 114 confirmed data breaches) is the creation of a false narrative to obtain information or influence behavior."
- "One of the differences between pretexting and phishing events is the lack of reliance on malware installation in the former for the attacker to meet their end goal"
- "Amplification attacks take advantage of the ability to send small spoofed packets to services that, as part of their normal operation, will in turn reply back to the victim with a much larger response. It is similar to asking a friend “How are you?” and then receiving a twenty-minute response about the price of gas, how much they love CrossFitTM, their cat’s hairball problem, etc"

#### Cybersecurity: Time for a New Definition (Lawfare) - https://www.lawfareblog.com/cybersecurity-time-new-definition
- Cybersecurity: "Prevention of damage to, protection of, and restoration of computers, electronic communications systems, electronic communications services, wire communication, and electronic communication, including information contained therein, to ensure its availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and nonrepudiation"
- "...our policies, were focused on protecting computer systems and their data, not on protecting people's minds from misinformation planted on networks users relied upon."

#### The Trinity of Trouble: Why the Problem is Growing (Freedom to Tinker) - https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2006/02/15/software-security-trinity-trouble/
- " In practice, the defect rate tends to go up as the square of code size. "

#### Tools and Techniques to Succeed at the Wall of Sheep (on wallofsheep.com) - http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0177/9886/files/2013_WOS_ToolsAndTechniques.pdf?47

#### The Basics of Arpspoofing/Arppoisoning (Irongeek.com) - http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=security/arpspoof
- "ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol and it allows the network to translate IP addresses into MAC addresses"

#### ARP Spoofing (Veracode) - https://www.veracode.com/security/arp-spoofing
